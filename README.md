# MirraMirra

The program is a very simple, functional smart mirror platform that aims to supply a much simpler setup and use case for people who just want simple features like time, weather, and compliments just for fun. It was developed in c# mostly as an effort to learn windows forms.

This is not designed to be a complex program making use of many APIs and does not intend to be a competitor to MagicMirror. Feel free to fork and improve this program any way you like.
